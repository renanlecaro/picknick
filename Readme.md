# Picnic: privacy first collaborative text editor.

Picnic is a very simple app that tries to solve one 
problem : You are trying to organise a picnic with 
friends on the beach and need to decide who brings what.

You could spam the whatsapp group with messages like 
"i'll bring sandwiches" and "i'll bring drinks" but
it quickly gets messy and difficult to know who brings 
what and what is missing.

With picnic, you just go to https://picnic.lecaro.me/,
edit the document to list everything that is needed, and
share the link to your friends. They can edit the doc without
any authentication, all that's needed is the link.

From a technical standpoint, the code is very simple and short,
and the number of dependencies is minimal. 

The hosted version of this software is provided without any garantee,
if you don't want your texts to dissappear one day I'd recommend setting 
up your own instance.
