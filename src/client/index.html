        Picnic is a very generic app that tries to solve one specific problem :
        You are organizing a picnic with friends and need to decide who brings
        what.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could spam the WhatsApp group with messages like "I'll bring
        sandwiches" and "I'll bring drinks", but it quickly gets messy and
        difficult to know who brings what and what is missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        With picnic, you just create a document, post the link in the group
        chat, and then edit it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hosted version of this software is provided without any guarantee,
        if you don't want your texts to disappear one day, I'd recommend setting
        up your own instance.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the text you write is encrypted before saving it, using the URL as a
        key. The encrypted text is sent to our servers, where it is saved and
        also forwarded to the other people editing your text. Each client then
        decodes the text using the key it knows from the URL. This means nobody
        else can read your documents, not even the platform that hosts them.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the only way to be sure is to control the platform where the
        app is hosted, that's why self-hosting this app is the best way to use
        it.
