        Picnic is a very generic app that tries to solve one specific problem :
        You are organizing a picnic with friends and need to decide who brings
        what.
      </p>
      <p>
        You could spam the WhatsApp group with messages like "I'll bring
        sandwiches" and "I'll bring drinks", but it quickly gets messy and
        difficult to know who brings what and what is missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        With picnic, you just create a document, post the link in the group
        chat, and then edit it together.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hosted version of this software is provided without any guarantee,
        if you don't want your texts to disappear one day, I'd recommend setting
        up your own instance.
      </p>
